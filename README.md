## Problem
Youths today **acknowledge the benefits of journaling**, such as stress relief and improved mindfulness, but they **do not actively engage in the habit of journaling**. Many struggle with the **lack of motivation**, perceiving journaling as a **time-consuming** and **mundane** activity, leading to **inconsistency** for those who already journal and a **lack of initiation** for potential new users.

## Solution
Bloom is our journaling application which addresses these challenges by sending users **spontaneous** daily prompts, helping youths integrate mindfulness and stress relief into their routines **without feeling burdened**. Bloom also features a virtual plot of land where users can plant a flower each time they complete their daily journal entry, thus **rewarding the experience and encouraging consistency**.
